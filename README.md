## Introduction

About my final project in CS50. My final project is all about class identifier; you can search your grade and section and it would find what class are you included in. You need to register (or log in), to make sure that you are really a student to know what class you belong in. You can also access a specific subject's information, limited if you are not logged in. This application may be exclusive to the school of Our Lady of Lourdes Academy of Bacoor Cavite Inc. You can suggest your suggestions at sarmientoemmener83@gmail.com.

## History

The history of my final project and why I make this project. So, I already completed labs and psets, and I cant think of any ideas of what should I made in my final project. One day my classmate ask for a link, then someone responsed with "you should try to backread with the GC", then someone send ALL the Zoom links (with subject) for our classes, then it inspires me to create a website with all the needed for an online class (Time, links, teacher).

## Programming languages/frameworks used

I used these programming languages/frameworks. First is of course, SQL; the use of it is to store data in the database, I choose **SQL** because it is one of the lectures of CS50 (week 7 and week 9). Second is **Python** specifically the Framework named Flask, it is used for the backend and to connect the database and the client (the thing you see). Third is HTML, CSS, and JS, these "frontend" libraries are just difficult to handle with that so I add **Tailwind CSS** to my CSS to make my life much more easier, then on HTML I add Jinja for my templating system, it can make your life easier. In JS, I dont add any frameworks (like Frontend frameworks, e.g. React, Angular, Vue, etc.) since it will probably make my life more harder than expected.

### Conflicts in creating my project

As I just said, I attempt to use React, but setting it up make it harder (e.g. fetching the data using FETCH), it took me about an hour and half just to set it up, so I just used HTML and Jinja. In CSS choosed tailwind over bootstrap framework because I want to try it, since one of my friends know tailwind and I got interested in it. I also struggled picking which database should I use; I am struggling to pick between using postgresSQL or sqlite3, I choose sqlite3 because it is in the lesson and it is comfortable. I also struggled picking an ORM (Objectâ€“relational mapping, i.e. converting code to SQL). I also created this on Vercel, but it was not easy to deploy it, so I decided to use Heroku. I also modified some of my code to suite the environment.

## How to use it.

To use it, first you need to register/login to your corresponding school role, or just find a subject without registering/logging in. After that, you can now see your subject/s.

And this was Class identifier
